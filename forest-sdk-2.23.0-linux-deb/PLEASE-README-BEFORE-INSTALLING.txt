NOTE: If you are installing on macOS Catalina, opening "Forest SDK <version>.pkg" may fail with a message like "cannot verify package". Instead, you must right-click on the ".pkg" file and then click "Open". This will be fixed in a future update.

Thank you for downloading the Forest SDK! The provided package will
install the Rigetti Quantum Virtual Machine, the Rigetti Quil
Compiler, and requisite dependencies.

For full installation and setup instructions, please see the
documentation page:
